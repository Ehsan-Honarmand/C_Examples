Welcome to the tutorial series for C language.\n

C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories. In 1989, the C language was standardized, where C language features were defined, also known as the 1989 ANSI standard for C, and that is the reason, you will see C language also called C89, because of the 1989 ANSI standard.
The current latest version of the C language is C99, as some new features were added to the C language in 1999.
You must be thinking, 1999 was more than 20 years ago, but the C language is still very relevant and widely used although there are many other new languages like C++, Java, Python, C#, etc. in the market.
